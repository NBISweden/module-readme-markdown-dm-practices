The course introduces several tools for live coding Markdown:

* [markdownlivepreview.com](https://markdownlivepreview.com/): A simple, web-based Markdown editor that provides a live preview of your Markdown text as you type.
* [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/): An online Markdown editor that supports live preview and allows importing/exporting files from sources like GitHub, Dropbox, and Google Drive.
* [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#): A more advanced, web-based Markdown editor with offline editing, cloud synchronization, and collaboration features.

Additionally, [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for those who prefer a local editor, but this tool is not needed to do the exercises and can be installed after the course. VS Code supports Markdown with live preview and rendering capabilities.
